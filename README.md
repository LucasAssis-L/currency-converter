# Currency Converter Project

This is a currency converter project using the CurrencyApi, it was created using Vite and React, to run it type "npm run dev" on terminal or your IDE.

In order to use your own key from CurrencyApi modify the key in the ".env.development" file.


## What would I improve at

- Create a message component to show errors, sucesses and others to the user
- Handle better the masks for the input, probably using Regex and adding the currency symbols before the values
- Solve and improve on how the Jest tests are running
